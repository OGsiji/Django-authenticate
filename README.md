## Features

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to integrate the authentication page template into your Django project:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OGsiji/Django-authenticate.git
    ```

2. Copy the authentication templates to your Django project's template directory.

    ```bash
    cp -r django-authentication-template/templates/* yourproject/templates/
    ```

3. Integrate the template's URLs into your project's `urls.py`:

    ```python
    from django.urls import path, include

    urlpatterns = [
        path('', include('authentication.urls')),
        # ... other URL patterns in your project
    ]
    ```

4. Configure your project's `settings.py`:

    - Make sure you have `'django.contrib.auth'` and `'django.contrib.contenttypes'` in your `INSTALLED_APPS`.
    - Set up email settings for the password reset functionality.

5. Customize the template as needed. You can modify the HTML and CSS in the template files to match your project's design and branding.

## Usage

After integrating the template into your Django project and making the necessary configurations, you can run your project and access the authentication pages. Users will be able to register, log in, reset their password, and manage their profiles.

Feel free to extend the template and add additional functionality, such as two-factor authentication, social login, or custom user fields, to meet your project's requirements.
